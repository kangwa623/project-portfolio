## **Abstract**

The agricultural sector is one of the beneficiaries of technological advancements. Innovative solutions help address challenges and improve efficiency. 
Some of the challenges include too much time spent on physical monitoring, nutrient depletion due to grazing on specific patches of land, and the loss or theft of livestock. 
One solution is the implementation of real-time location and health monitoring of livestock. 
This paper explores the development of a low-cost functional GPS-based tracking device facilitated by in-house PCB manufacturing. 
The device was designed to integrate an ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 microcontroller, a Quectel LC86G GNSS module, and an MPU-6050 accelerometer. 
The microcontroller chosen enabled efficient, low-power, peer-to-peer communication in a network, eliminating the need for cellular infrastructure. 
The PCB was designed using KiCad and developed using the Dry Film Photoresist Method. 
Field testing demonstrated a reliable communication range of approximately 210 meters between two sensor nodes, thus validating the system’s ability to track animal movements and patterns. 
This prototype demonstrated the potential of locally built, cost-effective IoT solutions in promoting Precision Livestock Farming, thus enhancing livestock welfare. 
It demonstrated the capacity to produce a Minimum Viable Product specifically tailored to the needs of rural and underserved communities, thus promoting inclusion in the technology revolution.
