## **Introduction**  
ReviZa is a mobile application designed to facilitate the sharing and access of past papers and 
other academic resources specifically for university students. This project was conceptualized in 
response to a significant challenge faced by the student population: the scarcity of centralized, 
high-quality academic resources. Currently, students rely heavily on platforms like WhatsApp 
and Telegram to share study materials. However, these platforms are not optimized for academic 
use and often result in disorganized and repeated sharing of files, leading to inefficiencies in 
accessing study resources.   

## **Problem Statement**  
The primary problem addressed by ReviZa is the lack of streamlined, high-quality, and 
centralized access to study materials for Zambian university students. The unstructured 
distribution of materials across various messaging applications not only hinders efficient access 
but also poses challenges in revising and retaining academic information effectively. Our goal 
was to create a specialized platform tailored to meet the unique needs of university students in 
Zambia. 

## **Market Research**
To better understand the market, we analysed similar applications, including Khan Academy, 
Studocu, and Estudy. Although these applications provide educational content, we observed 
several limitations:

- **Khan Academy:** While highly educational, this platform does not cater to the Zambian 
university curriculum, which limits its effectiveness for our target audience.  

- **Studocu:** This platform has a wide range of materials, but it lacks alignment with the Zambian 
syllabus, making it less relevant to local students.   

- **Estudy:** Although this application focuses on academic material, it lacks sufficient content to 
fully support students in higher education.  

Based on our research, we identified an opportunity to develop an application specifically 
designed to address the needs of Zambian university students.  

## **Target Audience**  
The primary audience for ReviZa is higher education students in Zambia who require access to 
study materials tailored to the local university curriculum. This includes students from diverse 
academic disciplines who seek reliable resources to enhance their learning and revision 
processes.

## **Accomplishments**  
The mobile app was built and deployed on the Google Play Store, with future plans of deploying it on the App Store. 
The funding secured by winning the hackathon, helped facilitate the costs associated with the initial launch.

## **Challenges**  
Firstly, the main challenge experienced was the issue of ownership and copyright. This challenge 
was mitigated by limiting access to the material to students only. This was further implemented 
by using student identification cards to verify that the user is indeed a student.

Secondly, hosting was another challenge that arose, mainly because a system of such caliber 
requires hosting fees for Google Cloud storage. 

Finally, attracting initial investors was challenging until we participated in the Zambia@60 
hackathon, where our vision and the potential impact on the Zambian e-learning landscape 
gained support. 

## **Conclusion**  
ReviZa has the potential to revolutionize education and the e-learning landscape in Zambia and 
across Africa by building on sustainable business models from the Western world and local 
competitors, while offering a unique selling point that is both cost-effective for the African 
market and profitable.
