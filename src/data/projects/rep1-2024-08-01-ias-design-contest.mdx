# **Technical Report**

![Competition Poster](/og-images/projects/reports-ieee24-ias-ipcsd.jpg)  

## **Project Scope**  
This project proposes an innovative renewable energy power conditioning system.
Basically, a Smart Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) Charge controller divided into three (3) main parts. 

✅ **MPPT Design**.  
✅ **IoT Keylogging Module Design**.  
✅ **Customised Web Server & Cloud Infrastructure**.   

## **Purpose**  
- The motivation behind this project stemmed from the high costs of Commercial
Charge Controllers in Zambia.
 
- The main purpose of the system is to enable the spark of rural electrification in
Zambia and Africa at large. Our proposed design emphasizes on its low cost with
the hope of reduce cost of rural electrification.
