## **Abstract**  
Cervical cancer remains the most prevalent form of cancer among women in Zambia,
contributing significantly to delayed treatment and high mortality rates. At the Cancer
Diseases Hospital (CDH-UTH), radiologists face substantial workflow challenges,
including prolonged turnaround times for report generation. This project proposes a
semi-automated software solution to streamline radiology workflows and reduce
reporting delays. The system integrates a structured checklist interface, FIGO staging
support, and an editable AI-assisted report generator, all deployed via a web-based
platform built with ReactJS and Express.js. A pilot evaluation involving radiologists at
CDH demonstrated strong usability and workflow alignment, with positive feedback on
interface clarity and reduced manual effort. The solution also incorporates metadata
extraction, standardized reporting formats, and plans for integrating a fine-tuned
machine learning model. By enhancing reporting efficiency and supporting clinical
decision-making, the system aims to improve patient outcomes and contribute to
scalable cancer care innovation in low-resource settings.
