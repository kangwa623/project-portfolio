## **Abstract**

This study proposes the design of a photovoltaic (PV) system to power agricultural activities in rural communities, with a focus on Sub-Saharan Africa. 
Considering the high costs of most PV systems for rural economies, the proposed design emphasises affordability. 
The system comprises a PV array converting solar energy to electricity and powering a DC water pump. 
To improve the efficiency of the system a step further, automation with an Arduino system optimises water usage. 
This automation not only conserves water but also extends the pump's lifespan and reduces maintenance costs. 
Also, efficient irrigation improves the quality and quantity of agricultural produce for the local communities. 
In the proposed design, a maize field with an estimated two-hectare size, located in Chisunka Luongo, Zambia, 
is used to check both the economic and technical feasibility of the irrigation system proposed in this paper. 
Weather data from PVGIS aided in assessing the design's technical feasibility, 
while an analysis of the life cycle cost-effectiveness and environmental benefits of the system is also presented. 
Affordability was a priority in the system design, catering to various farming communities. 
Results indicate that our proposed system is cost-effective compared to other solar energy irrigation solutions, 
effectively meeting the irrigation demand of surrounding farming communities.
