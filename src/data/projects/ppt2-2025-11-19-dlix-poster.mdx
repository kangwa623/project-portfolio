## **Introduction**  
In Zambia, the scarcity of radiologists has resulted in significant delays in cancer treatment, with patients waiting up to three months for their first treatment after diagnosis. 
Specifically, there are less than 15 radiologists in the public sector [1]. One of the primary contributing factors to this delay is the turnaround time, 
which refers to the period between a radiologist receiving images and sending back a report [2]. Research shows that cancer continues to be one of the leading causes of death worldwide [3]. 
Cervical cancer in Zambia is the most popular form of cancer, accounting for 41.1% in females and 23.8% in overall cases nationwide. 
Additionally, among the various forms of cancer, cervical cancer is ranked first as causing the most deaths in Zambia at 23.4% [4].

## **Objectives**  
1. To demonstrate the understanding of the cervical cancer staging workflow.<br/>
2. To design and implement a software that assists radiologists as they interpret images and generate reports.<br/>
3. To evaluate the effectiveness and usefulness of the implementation.
