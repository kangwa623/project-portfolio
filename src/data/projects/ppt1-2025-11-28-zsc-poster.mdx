## **Abstract**
Cervical cancer remains the most prevalent form of cancer among women in
Zambia, contributing significantly to delayed treatment and high mortality
rates. At the Cancer Diseases Hospital (CDH-UTH), radiologists face
substantial workflow challenges, including prolonged turnaround times for
report generation. This project proposes a semi-automated software solution to
streamline radiology workflows and reduce reporting delays. The system
integrates a structured checklist interface, FIGO staging support, and an
editable AI-assisted report generator, all deployed via a web-based platform
built with ReactJS and Express.js. A pilot evaluation involving radiologists at
CDH demonstrated strong usability and workflow alignment, with positive
feedback on interface clarity and reduced manual effort. The solution also
incorporates metadata extraction, standardized reporting formats, and plans for
integrating a fine-tuned machine learning model. By enhancing reporting
efficiency and supporting clinical decision-making, the system aims to
improve patient outcomes and contribute to scalable cancer care innovation in
low-resource settings.
